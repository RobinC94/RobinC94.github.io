# About Me

Hi, it is Robin Chen, an AI researcher from China. I work at SenseTime Group in Shanghai, after receiving Master Degree in SJTU. I'm highly interested in AI technology and researches. Also other hobbies and interests arise in many aspects far from you know. To some extent I can say "I know everything a little bit", shamelessly.

This is my online page, or maybe blog in the future, still in progress. Feel free to drop me a line at leonharddt@gmail.com.
